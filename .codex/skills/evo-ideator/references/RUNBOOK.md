# RUNBOOK — how to use the skill

## Quick invocation
Example:
- `Use the $evo-ideator skill: invent an AI product that can reach $10k/mo quickly; no plan, idea only`

## If the evoidea binary exists
If the `evoidea` binary supports the legacy `run` subcommand, the skill may run `scripts/run_evoidea.sh`.

## If the binary is missing
The skill performs an instruction-only loop and still writes artifacts.

## Parameters (how to ask in plain text)
- "6 iterations, population 12"
- "with research"
- "no plan, best idea only"
